I thought I should finally start creating posts about things that matter to me, rants that matter to no one, and maybe also share some of the madness I come across or create.

This blog was built using Jekyll, planning to be (at the time this is live, hopefully will be) hosted on Github Pages, uses LESS for styles and I am currently trying to not use jQuery and as little JavaScript as possible (lets see how long that lasts, eh?).

Excuse me while I test out some code snippet stuff.

{% highlight javascript %}
	alert('Hello world!');
{% endhighlight %}

In the meantime (aka while i'm trying to cook up more posts), Check out my [Twitter][twitter] for random tweets and my [Github][github] for some of my projects.
