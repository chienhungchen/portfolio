MultiLevelSelect.js is a jQuery plugin that makes it easier for developers to create select menus that require multiple levels of designation. A great example of this would be having a select menu to choose location based on state, then city.

Currently only supports a full JSON of the data. Future version intends to open up to AJAX for querying larger amounts of data.

See code on Github: [https://github.com/chienhungchen/MultiLevelSelect][multilevelselect_github]

Currently in version 1.0!
