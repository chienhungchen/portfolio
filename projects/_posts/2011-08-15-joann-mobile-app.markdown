The mobile app I developed during my internship at Jo-Ann's Headquarters was designed for internal use. It was also used as a prototypal project to demonstrate the feasibility of developing mobile apps in house. After all, if an intern can do it, it can't be that hard right? :)

The internship itself was a great experience, and I walked away with experience working with some Google technologies such as Google Secure Data Connector and Google Widgets and Google App Engine, as well as with the Titanium SDK, a cross-platform JavaScript based mobile development platform.

Before leaving my internship at Jo-Ann's, I obtained permission from Dave Leonard, my manager during my internship there to take and share screenshots of the mobile app I worked on while being there.
